name: assets-move
description: Move or rename assets at the given project paths. Refreshes the AssetDatabase at the end. Moving/renaming can break references in scenes, prefabs and scripts — verify with 'assets-find' afterwards. Use 'assets-find' to locate the assets first.

# Assets / Move

Move the assets at paths in the project. Should be used for asset rename. Does AssetDatabase.Refresh() at the end. Use 'assets-find' tool to find assets before moving.

## Warning

Moving or renaming an asset can break references to it from scenes, prefabs, materials and scripts. Unity usually retargets references for moves inside `Assets/`, but verify the result with 'assets-find' and check the Console for reference errors afterwards.

## Inputs

- `sourcePaths` — paths of the assets to move.
- `destinationPaths` — target paths (must match `sourcePaths` length).

## Behavior

Each pair is moved independently via `AssetDatabase.MoveAsset`. Per-pair failures (Unity's `MoveAsset` returns a non-empty error string) are surfaced in `response.Errors`; successful moves accumulate into `response.MovedPaths`.

## How to Call

Call this tool through the MCP client connected to the local Matrix AI Connector server.

Example input:
```json
{
  "sourcePaths": {},
  "destinationPaths": {}
}
```

> For complex input, keep the payload as valid JSON and send it through your connected MCP client.

Read the /feeder-mcp-initial-setup skill for local connection setup.
