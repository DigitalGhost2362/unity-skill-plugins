name: scene-open
description: Open a Unity scene asset in Single or Additive mode. Returns the post-open list of all opened scenes. Use 'assets-find' to locate the scene asset first.

# Scene / Open

Open scene from the project asset file. Use 'assets-find' tool to find the scene asset first.

## Inputs

- `sceneRef` — `AssetObjectRef` pointing at a `SceneAsset`. Throws if the asset cannot be resolved or is not a `SceneAsset`.
- `loadSceneMode` (default `Single`):
  - `Single` — closes the currently opened scenes and opens this one.
  - `Additive` — keeps the currently opened scenes and opens this one alongside them.

## How to Call

Call this tool through the MCP client connected to the local Matrix AI Connector server.

Example input:
```json
{
  "sceneRef": {
    "instanceID": 0
  },
  "loadSceneMode": "Single"
}
```

> For complex input, keep the payload as valid JSON and send it through your connected MCP client.

Read the /feeder-mcp-initial-setup skill for local connection setup.

## Input

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `sceneRef` | `any` | Yes | Reference to UnityEngine.Object asset instance. It could be Material, ScriptableObject, Prefab, and any other Asset. Anything located in the Assets and Packages folders. |
| `loadSceneMode` | `string` | No | Open scene mode. Single: closes the current scenes and opens a new one. Additive: keeps the current scene and opens additional one. |
