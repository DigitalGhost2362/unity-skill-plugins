name: package-remove
description: Uninstall a UPM package from the Unity project. Modifies `manifest.json` and may trigger a domain reload — the final result is delivered after the reload via the request's `requestId`. Built-in packages and packages that are dependencies of others cannot be removed. Removing a package whose API is used by project code breaks compilation — check usages with 'package-list' (and search the codebase) first.

# Package Manager / Remove

Remove (uninstall) a package from the Unity project. This removes the package from the project's manifest.json and triggers package resolution. Note: Built-in packages and packages that are dependencies of other installed packages cannot be removed. Note: Package removal may trigger a domain reload. The result will be sent after the reload completes. Use 'package-list' tool to list installed packages first.

## Warning

If project code uses APIs from the removed package, compilation breaks until that code is migrated. Confirm the package is unused (or that you are ready to fix the fallout) before removing.

## Inputs

- `packageId` — package name (e.g. `com.unity.textmeshpro`). A trailing `@<version>` is stripped automatically before being passed to `Client.Remove`, so accidental versioned IDs still work.

## Behavior

First verifies the package is installed via an offline `Client.List` — returns a clear `PackageNotFound` error if not. On removal failure, surfaces Unity's error message. On success, schedules a post-domain-reload notification so the response is delivered after Unity finishes the resolution.

## How to Call

Call this tool through the MCP client connected to the local Matrix AI Connector server.

Example input:
```json
{
  "packageId": "value"
}
```

> For complex input, keep the payload as valid JSON and send it through your connected MCP client.
