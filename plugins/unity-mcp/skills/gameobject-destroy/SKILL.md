name: gameobject-destroy
description: Destroy a GameObject (and all nested children) in the currently opened Prefab or active Scene. IRREVERSIBLE — the object is removed immediately without undo, so verify the exact target with 'gameobject-find' first. Returns the destroyed GameObject's name, path, and instance ID for confirmation.

# GameObject / Destroy

Destroy GameObject and all nested GameObjects recursively in opened Prefab or in a Scene. Use 'gameobject-find' tool to find the target GameObject first.

## Warning

This is IRREVERSIBLE: `DestroyImmediate` removes the GameObject and all its children immediately, with no undo entry. In a Prefab edit stage the deletion is written back to the prefab asset when the stage is closed (saved). Always verify the exact target with 'gameobject-find' before calling.

## Behavior

Validates the `gameObjectRef`, resolves it on the main thread, then calls `Object.DestroyImmediate` (the immediate variant is required for Editor-mode operations). Returns a `DestroyGameObjectResult` containing `DestroyedName`, `DestroyedPath`, and `DestroyedInstanceId` so the caller has a record of what was removed.

## How to Call

Call this tool through the MCP client connected to the local Matrix AI Connector server.

Example input:
```json
{
  "gameObjectRef": {
    "instanceID": 0
  }
}
```

> For complex input, keep the payload as valid JSON and send it through your connected MCP client.

Read the /feeder-mcp-initial-setup skill for local connection setup.

## Input

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
