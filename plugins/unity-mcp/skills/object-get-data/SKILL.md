name: object-get-data
description: Get serialized data for a Unity `UnityEngine.Object` — all serializable fields and properties. Supports token-saving path-scoped reads via `paths` or `viewQuery`. Pair with 'object-modify' when you need to write back. For asset files on disk use 'assets-get-data' instead.
---

# Object / Get Data

Get data of the specified Unity Object. Returns serialized data of the object including its properties and fields. If need to modify the data use 'object-modify' tool.

## When to use / when not

- Use for any live `UnityEngine.Object` you already have a reference to (by instanceID) — components, scene objects, in-memory assets.
- Do NOT use for asset files on disk — use 'assets-get-data' instead. To find a scene GameObject use 'gameobject-find'.

## Path-scoped reads (token-saving)

Supply `paths` (a list of paths) to read only the listed fields/elements via `Reflector.TryReadAt`, or `viewQuery` (a `ViewQuery`) to navigate to a subtree and/or filter by name regex / max depth / type via `Reflector.View`. These two parameters are mutually exclusive — supply at most one. When neither is supplied the full object is serialized (backwards compatible).

## Path syntax

`fieldName`, `nested/field`, `arrayField/[i]`, `dictField/[key]`. Leading `#/` is stripped.

## How to Call

Call this tool through the MCP client connected to the local Matrix AI Connector server.

Example input:
```json
{
  "objectRef": {
    "instanceID": 0
  },
  "paths": [],
  "viewQuery": {}
}
```

> For complex input, keep the payload as valid JSON and send it through your connected MCP client.

## Input

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `objectRef` | `any` | Yes | Reference to UnityEngine.Object instance. It could be GameObject, Component, Asset, etc. Anything extended from UnityEngine.Object. |
| `paths` | `any` | No | Optional. List of paths to read individually via Reflector.TryReadAt. Each path may target a different depth. Path syntax: 'fieldName', 'nested/field', 'arrayField/[i]', 'dictField/[key]'. Mutually exclusive with 'viewQuery'. |
| `viewQuery` | `any` | No | Optional. View-query filter routed through Reflector.View — combines a starting Path, a case-insensitive NamePattern regex, MaxDepth, and an optional TypeFilter. Mutually exclusive with 'paths'. |
