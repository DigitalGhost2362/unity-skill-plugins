description: Create a new Material asset with default parameters at a given 'Assets/'-rooted path ending in '.mat'. Creates intermediate folders if missing. Use 'assets-shader-list-all' to find a valid `shaderName`.

# Assets / Create Material

Create new material asset with default parameters. Creates folders recursively if they do not exist. Provide proper 'shaderName' - use 'assets-shader-list-all' tool to find available shaders.

## Inputs

- `assetPath` — must start with `Assets/` and end with `.mat`.
- `shaderName` — name resolvable via `UnityEngine.Shader.Find`.

## Behavior

Throws if the path is empty, malformed, or the shader cannot be resolved. Creates a default Material from the resolved shader, saves it, refreshes the AssetDatabase, and returns an `AssetObjectRef` pointing at the new asset.

## How to Call

Call this tool through the MCP client connected to the local Matrix AI Connector server.

Example input:
```json
{
  "assetPath": "value",
  "shaderName": "value"
}
```

> For complex input, keep the payload as valid JSON and send it through your connected MCP client.

Read the /feeder-mcp-initial-setup skill for local connection setup.

## Input

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `assetPath` | `string` | Yes | Asset path. Starts with 'Assets/'. Ends with '.mat'. |
| `shaderName` | `string` | Yes | Name of the shader that need to be used to create the material. |
