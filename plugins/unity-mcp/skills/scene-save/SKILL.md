name: scene-save
description: Save an opened scene back to its asset file (or to a new path when `path` is provided). When `openedSceneName` is empty, saves the currently active scene. Use 'scene-list-opened' to find the scene name first.

# Scene / Save

Save Opened scene to the asset file. Use 'scene-list-opened' tool to get the list of all opened scenes.

## Inputs

- `openedSceneName` (optional) — name of an opened scene to save. Empty/null = active scene.
- `path` (optional) — destination `.unity` path. Empty/null = save back to the scene's existing path.

## Validation

Throws if the scene cannot be resolved, has no existing path AND no override path was supplied, or the supplied path does not end with `.unity`. On `EditorSceneManager.SaveScene` failure, surfaces an error with the current opened-scenes list for diagnosis.
