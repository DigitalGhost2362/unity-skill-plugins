# Assets / Prefab / Close

Close currently opened prefab. Use it when you are in prefab editing mode in Unity Editor. Use 'assets-prefab-open' tool to open a prefab first.

## Inputs

- `save` (default `true`) — when `true`, calls `PrefabUtility.SaveAsPrefabAsset` before exiting the stage; when `false`, the save is skipped. The prefab stage's dirtiness is always cleared at the end, so any unsaved changes are discarded when `save` is `false`.

## Behavior

Throws when no prefab stage is currently open. Returns an `AssetObjectRef` for the closed prefab asset.

## How to Call

Call this tool through the MCP client connected to the local Matrix AI Connector server.

Example input:
```json
{
  "save": false
}
```

> For complex input, keep the payload as valid JSON and send it through your connected MCP client.

Read the /feeder-mcp-initial-setup skill for local connection setup.

## Input

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `save` | `boolean` | No | True to save prefab. False to discard changes. |
