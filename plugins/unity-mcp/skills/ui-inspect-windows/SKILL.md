name: ui-inspect-windows
description: "List every EditorWindow currently alive in the Unity Editor — type, title, rect, focus, dock state, and whether it has a UI Toolkit element tree. Entry point for the ui-inspect tool family: pick a window here, then drill in with 'ui-inspect-tree'."

# UI / Inspect Windows

Lists all open EditorWindows so the AI can pick one to inspect.

## Output

For each window: full type name (use as `windowName` in the other ui-inspect tools), tab title, desktop rect, focus/dock state, and `RootChildCount` — when it is 0 the window is pure IMGUI and its content cannot be traversed by the UI inspector.
