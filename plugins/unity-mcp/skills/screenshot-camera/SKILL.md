description: Capture a screenshot from a Unity `Camera` and return it as a PNG image for direct LLM inspection. Falls back to `Camera.main` (then any active camera) when `cameraRef` is null. Width and height are capped to keep response size manageable.

# Screenshot / Camera

Captures a screenshot from a camera and returns it as an image. If no camera is specified, uses the Main Camera. Returns the image directly for visual inspection by the LLM.

## Inputs

- `cameraRef` (optional) — reference to a GameObject hosting a `Camera`. When null, `Camera.main` is used; if there is no main camera, the first entry of `Camera.allCameras` is used.
- `width` (default 1920) / `height` (default 1080) — output pixels. Must be > 0 and ≤ `MaxDimension`.

## Behavior

Allocates a temporary `RenderTexture`, swaps it onto the chosen camera, calls `Camera.Render`, reads back via `Texture2D.ReadPixels`, encodes as PNG, and restores the camera's prior `targetTexture`. Returns a `ResponseCallTool.Image` with `image/png` MIME and a descriptive caption.

## How to Call

Call this tool through the MCP client connected to the local Matrix AI Connector server.

Example input:
```json
{
  "cameraRef": {
    "instanceID": 0
  },
  "width": 0,
  "height": 0
}
```

> For complex input, keep the payload as valid JSON and send it through your connected MCP client.

Read the /feeder-mcp-initial-setup skill for local connection setup.

## Input

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `cameraRef` | `any` | No | Reference to the camera GameObject. If not specified, uses the Main Camera. |
| `width` | `integer` | No | Width of the screenshot in pixels. |
| `height` | `integer` | No | Height of the screenshot in pixels. |
