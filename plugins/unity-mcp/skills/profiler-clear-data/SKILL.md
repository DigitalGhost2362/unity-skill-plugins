# Profiler / Clear Data

Invokes `UnityEditorInternal.ProfilerDriver.ClearAllFrames()` on the main thread. `UnityEditorInternal` is a built-in editor namespace — no external Unity package is required.

## Behavior

After this call, the Profiler window's frame history is empty; subsequent recording starts from frame 0. Returns `true` on success.

## How to Call

Call this tool through the MCP client connected to the local Matrix AI Connector server.

Example input:
```json
{
  "nothing": "value"
}
```

> For complex input, keep the payload as valid JSON and send it through your connected MCP client.

Read the /feeder-mcp-initial-setup skill for local connection setup.
